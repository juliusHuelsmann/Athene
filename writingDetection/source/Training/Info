//               Contains the
//               functionality for generating a scale / and rotation invariant
//               hough voting space for one character
//               that may be used for direct corollation 
//               approach to hough voting. 
// 
//               Requires:
//                 a) Size of the image that is to be generated
//                 b) Different scales, rotations 
//                 c) Path to the sample image data (vector<String>)  
//               Computes:
//                 i) vector<vector <Mat> > hough voting space to be multiplied
//                    with the image that is to be checked. Stores it inside
//                    the class
//               
//               Is part of a c++ project that is communicating with a java
//               program. It receives an approximate location from the java
//               program and extracts the text that is displayed at specified
//               location on screen.
//
//               Problems / Improvements
//                 1) the program won't be able to adapt to different screen 
//                    sizes. Once started, the program has to react to 
//                    different monitor settings / new monitors branched
//                    / different workspace used.
//                 
//                    !!! 
//                        This has been misunderstood. I think i need to extract
//                        snipplets. Their size differes often. Max snipplet 
//                        size!
//                    !!! 
//
